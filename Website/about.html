<center><p><h1><b>About Tiger Radio</b></h1></p>
	<center><h2>More Music Than Anyone Else.<h2>
	<p>WQTR-FM is an actual FM radio station broadcasting on 106.1 FM from the campus of Hardin County High School. It's run entirely by the students of Hardin County High School's three broadcasting classes and overseen by Mr. Ron Shank, a broadcasting veteran, previously co-host of the JJ and Ron in the Morning Show and Program Director at American Family Radio, a national radio network comprised of nearly 200 stations.</p>
    <p><h3>We are a “new and improved Tiger Radio.”
We are now playing music that targets the
parents and students of HCHS, increasing
time spent listening in one of the most
important listener demographics. Our variety
of hits from the 80s, 90s through today
makes it easy to listen to at work and
throughout the day.</h3></p></center>
<p><h3>What Makes Us Different:</h3></p>
<p><h3>We are a non-profit educatioanl station and therefore, we are restricted by law from advertising. But like public radio and Christian radio, we are allowed to accept sponshorships, also known as underwriting. Federal Law prohibits us "calls to action" like, "Call NOW! Come on down! Hurry, Hurry, Hurry! Etc" But there are things we can do.</h3></p>
<h2>A Better Way</h2>
<h3><p>Many business owners think underwriting is
a better way for your business to get the
word out. Let’s face it, when you are in your
car and you hear a commercial on the radio,
you probably do like most people do and
change the station. When you sponsor Tiger
Radio, you are quickly labeled as a sponsor
in a very unobtrusive way. We take fewer
breaks and our listeners not only appreciate
us for it, but they will also appreciate you as
a sponsor.</p></h3>
<h2>Student Run</h2>
<h3><p>The biggest reason people listen is our
content is student-run. Students read the
news, report on weather and sports scores,
conduct interviews, and it’s a student who
will record and produce your underwriting
announcement.</p></h3>
	<h2>We Need You!</h2>
	<h3><p>To be perfectly honest, we need you. To
	
operate this program with excellence is

expensive and we need sponsors, like you, to

make it all it can be. Thank you again for

your support.</p></h3>
<h3><p>Sincerely,</p></h3>
<h3><p>The Tiger Radio Staff and Website Developers, and Moderators</p></h3>
